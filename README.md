# Amazon Redesign (Open Source Project)

This is one of my biggest projects ever. This Project uses ReactJS, NextJS, Redux and Tailwind CSS

This is an open source project where anyone can make a pull request to this repo and update the repo

But how do u create a pull request?? ðŸ‘‡

Click on fork in the top left corner of your screen. Clone the repo you have been redirected to

`git clone https://github.com/PranavRajesh23032008/Amazon-Clone-ReDesign.git`

Installing dependencies
If you use yarn then run

`yarn install`
and if you use npm delete yarn.lock and run

`npm install`

Creating a new branch:-

```git checkout -b new-feature```
Starting server
If you are using yarn then run

`yarn dev`
and if you using npm run

`npm run dev`
You can use some accounts to test your features.


Submitting the new features.
Pushing the code to Github

`git add .`

`git commit -m "commit message (what you added)"`

`git push origin new-feature`

In github if you refresh the pageðŸ”ƒ.

You can see a button Compare and Pull request.
Click on that button.
Now just add a title and description and create a pull request.

ðŸ¥³You have successfully created a pull request and I will review and merge it soon.
